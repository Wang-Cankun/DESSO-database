# DESSO database

## Description

DEESO is a method for cis-regulatory motif prediction using deep neural networks and the binomial distribution model. The DESSO database provides computed details of human transcription factor binding sites information, as well as uploads ChIP-seq dataset to predict cis-regulatory motifs using pre-trained models. The DESSO database records 690 human ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets, 185 transcription factors datasets related to 20 cancer types, and 3 Single-cell ChIP-seq datasets.
